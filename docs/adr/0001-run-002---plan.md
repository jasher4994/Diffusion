# 0001: Run 002 - plan

Date: 2025-06-07

## Status
Plan to fix the issues from run-001

## Context
Run 1 flatlined after 40 epochs and the loss didnt really fall below 0.06

## Decision
- increase inference steps during training (x2)
- increase baseline channells in the model to give it more information when trainings. (x2)
- Increase LR to 1e-5 from 3e-6


## Alternatives Considered
 - Could still be an architectural issue but lets park that for now. 
 - Could also still likely be the pixel size too low, but will also park that for now. 

## Consequences
...
